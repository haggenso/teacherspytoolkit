# teacherspytoolkit
As teacher we are all very busy. It is hard to take some time out to practise Python programming. The aim of this project is to use Python to execute some mandate work and practise Python programming at the same time. 

Currently there are 3 sets of scripts serving the following purposes:
1. Marksheet Generator - Take the class roster and a spreadsheet template to create individual marksheet to all students in the class.
1. Marks Collector - Having generating and did some marking, marks can be automatically collected into a CSV file.
1. Marksheet to PDF - Finalise the marksheets by converting them to PDF for archival purposes.
