# teacherspytoolkit
As teacher we are all very busy. It is hard to take some time out to practise Python programming. The aim of this project is to use Python to execute some mandate work and practise Python programming at the same time. 

I plan to release code for 3 projects:
1. Unpivot - A good amount of data on [Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/) is presented in pivot table format. This little script employ the openpyxl library and pandas.melt method to unpivot the data to a more raw format so that students can have more flexibility to create their own pivot table for data analysis.
1. Marksheet Generator - Take the class roster and a spreadsheet template to create individual marksheet to all students in the class.
1. Marks Collector - Having generating and did some marking, marks can be automatically collected into a spreadsheet.
